    <p>I want to visit a several places all over the world. So far, I have only visited few places that grabbed my attention. Although there are many places in and out of the country that I'd love to visit. Bale Mountains National Park is the place I'd like to visit the most. The prospect of exploring the pristine landscapes of the Harenna Forest and the expansive Sanetti Plateau is an enticing adventure. Beyond the scenic vistas, the park offers a unique opportunity to witness the endangered Ethiopian wolf in its native environment, adding an element of rarity and ecological significance to the experience. I have summarised list of places I want to visit in the following table.</p>
