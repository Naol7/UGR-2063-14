  <h2 >My <span>Hobbies</span></h2>
</div>
<p>During my free time, I engage in various activities. I often find solace in the pages of novels and self-help books, a routine I gravitate towards when not immersed in my studies. Recently, I delved into the captivating narratives of <cite>Atomic Habits</cite> and <cite>To Kill a Mockingbird</cite>, finding them both enriching. My other hobbies are movies and music.</p>
    <h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>
    <p>Watching movies is a cherished pastime for me. It serves as a means to divert my mind and provides entertainment that fuels my inspiration for acquiring new knowledge. Notably, films such as <cite>Pursuit of Happyness</cite>, <cite>Good Will Hunting</cite>, and <cite>Coach Carter</cite> hold a special place as my favorites in the cinematic realm. here is my favorite qoute from <cite>pursuit of happyness</cite></p>
    <blockquote>"As long as I kept my mental focus on destinations that were ahead, destinations that I had the audacity to dream might hold a red Ferrari of my own, I protected myself from despair. The future was uncertain, absolutely, and there were many hurdles, twists, and turns to come, but as long as I kept moving forward, one foot in front of the other, the voices of fear and shame, the messages from those who wanted me to believe that I wasn't good enough, would be stilled."</blockquote>

    <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
    <p>Beyond my enjoyment of movies and books, I also allocate time in my leisure for the pleasure of music. Delving into the soundscape is a cherished activity for me, and among my preferred artists are Bruno Mars, Kanye West, J Cole, and Adele, among others. Each artist brings a unique flavor to my playlist, offering a diverse range of musical experiences. Currently, one particular song has captured my attention, becoming a favorite in the present moment.</p>
